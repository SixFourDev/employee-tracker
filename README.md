## Usage

To use this tool, after you have already installed all the packages in Installation, you will want to right click "server.js" in your VS Code, then click "Open in Integrated Terminal". After the terminal has presented itself at the bottom, you will run "node server.js". You will then be connected to the database and be asked "What would you like to do" with a list of different options : "View all departments", "View all roles", "View all employees", "Add a department", "Add a role", "Add an employee", "Update an employee role", and "Exit". Selecting each View options will present you what you'll be looking for, all the add selections will automatically be added to the database, and when you run the view selections again the added contents will be there.
